<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there! My name is Christian X. Walls, I am 27 years old and currently working on becoming a full-stack web developer by learning HTML, CSS, JS and the rest.</p>

<p>I currently work as a CNA for the local hospital, and honestly, it sucks. Giving care to sick people isn't as noble as it may seem. It's hard work, frustrating, and
  seldom appreciated. It's my main motivator for studying and learning how to code; I want to get out of this hell that I work in. I can't count on other people to help
  make my life or my job any easier, and I'm going to be 30 soon. It's time I start the next phase of my life. No more grinding. It's about time I started a real career. 
</p>

<p>Anyways. When I'm not working or coding, I love playing video games, writing creatively, spending time with my wife watching Game of Thrones, or exploring Oregon
  and its many hikes & nature trails. I'm super duper ADHD so sometimes its hard to focus on stuff that sucks, but the nice part is that when I actually enjoy or am interested in what
  I'm doing, I get hyperfixated. Like right now, it was just 6:30, and now its 7:43 and I've been working on coding this entire time. It feels good turning my debuff into a buff!!
