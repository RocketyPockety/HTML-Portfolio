<h2>A list of some of my favorite films, with a short review of why I love them!</h2>

<h3>1. Avengers: Endgame</h3>
<p>Truly a masterclass in finales, this rollercoaster of a movie takes longtime fans of the MCU on one last ride with their favorite characters. The Avengers risk everything they have left to stop Thanos and return everyone back to life, and the emotional payoff is very rewarding for longtime fans who have grown up with the series.</p>
<h3>2. Hereditary</h3>
<p>Holy shit is this film terrifying. While a great deal of modern horror still takes its cues from shitty jumpscares, creepy CGI, and generally subpar screenwriting, Hereditary instead focuses on the falling apart of a family who is wrought with loss and pain. It's a slow burn, and takes some patience on the viewers part before the meat of the story starts getting really juicy, but by the end, it transforms into a trainwreck that the audience has no choice but to watch--and what a glorious wreck it becomes.</p>
<h3>3. Baby Driver</h3>
<p>While I love most of Edgar Wright's films, this one hold a special place in my heart. As someone who has always loved working to music, and would often time my actions to the beat of certain songs, watching Baby Driver had my inner child feeling particularly represented in film. Baby, the protagonist, bebops his way through the city, timing his steps, his driving, even his wipers, all to the beat of his favorite songs. It has humor, heart, charm, action, and most importantly, a fantastic musical score.</p>
